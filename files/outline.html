            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Case Study assignments in the course are designed to help you think more deeply about how you can apply the principles we are studying. You will do this by considering how you might approach a real-life conversation related to topics in the course. Please remember that in your response to these case studies, as in most real-life situations, you are not being asked to find solutions, but to offer care and support, and to share informed ideas based on doctrine and principles you have studied. It can also be helpful to remember that ongoing conversations are more effective than one-time conversations.</p>
            <h3>Guidelines on “how” to approach the situation</h3>
            <p>Many of life’s situations are complex. There are often no simple answers to the complex challenges we experience in mortality. Regardless of the situation, it is important to consider&nbsp;<strong><em>how</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>as well as&nbsp;<strong><em>what</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>you say.</p>
            <p>Before you focus on “what you say,” it might be important to explore “how” you also say it. Here are four guiding principles that can be helpful in addressing many different situations:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Listen with humility and love</li>
            <li>Continue in faith and recognize this may take time</li>
            <li>Keep an eternal perspective</li>
            <li>Help and encourage others along their journey</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Guidelines on “what” to teach</h3>
            <p>When we focus on growth and ministering, we will be respectful and avoid an attitude of being “holier than thou,” or “look how much smarter I am” when sharing doctrine. As we share doctrinal understanding, it is important to approach doctrine humbly and seek to identify teachings that best support someone in need. When you consider what to teach those you love, consider the following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Have the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles consistently proclaimed it in official Church publications?</li>
            <li>Does this doctrine reside in the standard works, official declarations, proclamations, or the&nbsp;Articles of Faith?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <p><strong>Case Study A</strong></p>
            <p>You have a friend who shares with you that he experiences same-sex attraction. He loves the Lord, loves the Church, but struggles to move forward in Church experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Case Study B</strong></p>
            <p>Recently, your bishop has been approached by several ward parents expressing concern about a recent decision of the local school board mandating an expanded curriculum in the school and that it does not align with gospel principles. Parents and children in the ward are having trouble having productive conversations. The bishop wants to discuss guiding principles regarding same-sex attraction, gender, and sexual intercourse before marriage.</p>
            <p><strong>Case Study C</strong></p>
            <p>One of your female friends feels that a woman’s voice is not heard or represented in the Church. She knows the Church has elevated women’s voices at the general level, but your friend does not feel her opinion and voice are heard in the Church.</p>
            <p><strong>Case Study D</strong></p>
            <p>Choose a situation in life that relates to what you are learning in this unit. (<em>Please remember when choosing your own case-study situation, it needs to be focused on the topics of the current weeks’ study and needs to include the required references as given in the instructions</em>.)</p>
